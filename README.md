# SOC-detection-lab
Simulated SOC detection lab focused on Windows event logs, basic detection logic and incident response considerations.
## Lab scope
This lab focuses on simulating and detecting suspicious authentication-related activity on a Windows system. The primary objective is to observe how such activity appears in Windows event logs and to document basic detection logic a SOC analyst could use.
### Planned scenarios
-Multiple failed logon attempts within a short time window
-Suspicious Powershell execution 
-Basic post-detection response consideration
