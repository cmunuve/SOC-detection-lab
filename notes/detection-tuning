# Detection tuning and limitations
  The failed logon detection implementation in this lab provides a useful starting point for identifying suspicious authentication activity. Writing this detection made it clear how quickly false positives could appear if thresholds are not carefully chosen.
## Potential false positives 
-Users mistyping passwords multiple times
-Service accounts with expired credentials
-Automated scripts or scheduled tasks 
### Tuning considerations
  To reduce noise, this detection could be tuned by:
  -Applying thresholds based on time windows
  -Excluding known service accounts
  -Correlating failed logon with successful authentication events
  #### Response considerations
  If this detection triggered an alert, a SOC analyst would:
  -Review the affected account and source system
  -Check for successful logons following failures
  -Escalate or contain if suspicious behavior persists
