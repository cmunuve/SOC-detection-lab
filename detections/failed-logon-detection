# Failed Logon Detection Logic
This detection focuses on identifying repeated failed authentication attempts that may indicate brute-force or credential-guessing activity.
## Detection criteria
-Event ID: 4625 (failed logon)
-Multiple occurrences within a short time window
-Same source system or account targeted repeatedly 
### Detection logic(conceptual)
If a single account or source generates more than a defined number of failed logon events within a short period of time, raise an alert for further investigation.
#### Notes
While simple this logic helped highlight how quickly failed logon events can accumulate and why thresholds matter in detection.
